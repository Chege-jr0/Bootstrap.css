//We have several ways of passing data.
//The first is the Unidirectional data flow where state flows in one direction down the tree of your application components from stateful parent component to the child component.
//The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken to just a few or maybe single, stateful component.
//The rest of your component simply receive state from the parent as props and render a UI from that state.
//There are different ways that we can pass data to the input field.

//In the example below we have passed the child components GetInput and RenderInput to the render in myApp
//We have created a prop called input in the GetInput child component and passed a prop called input
//We have also created a prop handleChange and passed the inputHandler handleChange to it
//In the RenderInput Child component we have created a prop called input and passed the input value from state to it.
